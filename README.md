# Data science: Apartments Distribution in Kenya

## Overview
This project seeks to analyze the distribution of apartments across different regions in Kenya, their pricing patterns, and the correlation between the number of bedrooms and their prices. By visualizing the data, we aim to identify trends, insights, and potential investment opportunities.
## Steps Involved
- **Data Collection**
  
  Data was collected from kaggle and stored in a structured CSV file for further analysis

- **Data cleaning**

  Identify and handle missing or null values in the dataset,
  Remove duplicates, if any, to ensure data accuracy, and
  ,perform data type conversions and standardize the data format if needed.

- **Data preparation**

  Explore the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of apartments and their attributes.
Conduct statistical analysis to understand the central tendencies and dispersion of prices and number of bedrooms.

- **Data Visualization**

  Use of popular data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn were employed to create insightful visualizations,
  Histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and other relevant charts were generated to illustrate the distribution of apartments and their attributes.
Analysis of trends and patterns in apartment prices and the number of bedrooms to draw meaningful conclusions.
